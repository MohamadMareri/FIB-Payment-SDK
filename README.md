### Carthage
[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks. 
- To integrate FIBPaymentSDK into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "https://github.com/MohamadMareri/FIB-Payment-SDK" ~> 1.0
```

- Close your Cartfile in Xcode and head back to Terminal. Run the following command:
```ogdl
carthage update --platform iOS
```
This instructs Carthage to clone the Git repositories that are specified in the Cartfile, and then build each dependency into a framework. 

The `--platform iOS` option ensures that frameworks are only built for iOS. If you donâ€™t specify a platform, then by default Carthage will build frameworks for all platforms (often both Mac and iOS) supported by the library.

By default, Carthage will perform its checkouts and builds in a new directory named `Carthage` in the same location as your Cartfile. Open up this directory now by running `open Carthage`
